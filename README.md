# Machine Learning Tutorials for Extragalactic Astronomy

Welcome to the Machine Learning Tutorials in Astronomy repository! This repository contains tutorials on various machine learning (ML) techniques applied to astronomy datasets. Each tutorial focuses on a specific ML algorithm and its application to open questions in astronomy.

## Tutorials Available:

1. **Random Forest Classifier (RFC):**
   - Tutorial Link: RFC.py
   - Description: This tutorial introduces the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm, and demonstrates its application in predicting galaxy types (central, satellite, orphan) from the galaxy stellar mass, star-formation rate, and local density.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):**
   - Tutorial Link: kNN.py
   - Description: Learn about K-Nearest Neighbors, a simple yet effective algorithm for classification, and apply it to predict galaxy redshifts from galaxy colours.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
   - Tutorial Link: SVM.py
   - Description: Explore Support Vector Machines, a versatile algorithm for classification, and understand how to use SVM to predict galaxy morphologies from galaxy colours.

### I am in the process of adding more fundamental tutorials to understand the behaviour of classifiers. Those are in Jupyter Notebook format and are taken from the book "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python - A guide for data scientists" by Andreas C. MÃ¼ller & Sarah Guido, 2017.  

## Usage:

- Each tutorial follows the following structure:
   1. How the algorithms works
   2. What its tunable parameters are
   3. What diagnostics we can use to assess the algorithm's performance on a dataset
   4. How we can improve its performance

- The code is written in Python and utilizes scikit-learn.

- Clone the repository to your local machine and request access to the data by the author in order to run the scripts.

## Dependencies:

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
- numpy
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- h5py
- seaborn
